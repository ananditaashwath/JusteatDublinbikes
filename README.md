# JusteatDublinbikes
Thesis of Data Science and Analytics course at National Univeristy of Ireland,Maynooth.
Bike Sharing systems are gaining popularity in numerous cities to boost the use of green
transportation. Management of bike rental schemes gives rise to numerous optimization
problems. Chief problem being bicycle rebalancing. This necessitates action to be taken
to balance the bikes at busy stations. This thesis investigates the bike usage patterns
considering various influential factors namely holidays and weather parameters for a 
period of one-year May 2019 to May 2020.
Covid-19 Pandemic period from March 2020 to May 2020 has also been considered for
analysis on the basis of bike usage. Machine learning algorithm have been used to 
predict the availability of bikes based on available bike stands to generate
recommendations for re-balancing of bikes at a given location.

# Data Collection
 Data has been acquired from JCDecaux API alongside weather data from Met Eireann 
 https://www.met.ie/forecasts/marine-inland-lakes/buoys website and holiday list from
 https://www.timeanddate.com/
